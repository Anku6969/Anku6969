## üåü Featured Projects

1. **Global Terrorism Dashboard**
-During my Data Analyst internship at InternCareer, I worked on a global terrorism data project using Power BI. I created visualizations that provided valuable insights into terrorist activities worldwide. Highlights of my work include pie and donut charts analyzing attack success rates by type, target, and weapon. I also used clustered bar and line charts to display success rates by region and the global attack trend over time. Additionally, I tracked incident counts with area charts and mapped terrorist activity geographically. To enrich user interaction, I implemented slicers, a decomposition tree, bookmarks, and a page navigator, enabling dynamic exploration of attack types, terrorist groups, and weapon types.
 Tools Used:- Microsoft Power BI, Microsoft Power Query, DAX

2. **YouTube Streamer Analysis**
   -Developed a Python-based data analysis solution for YouTube streamers data, focusing on trend analysis, audience engagement, and content performance. The project involved data cleaning, exploratory analysis, statistical analysis, and machine learning applications. Used pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, and scikit-learn for data processing and visualization. Implemented outlier removal and correlation studies, creating visualizations like bar plots, heatmaps, and box plots. Key findings: Top 10% of creators generate 70% of total views. 0.8 correlation between subscriber count and brand collaborations. Developed a linear regression model with 85% accuracy for predicting user engagement. 40% of top streamers' content falls into two categories. This analysis provides actionable insights for content creators and marketers to optimize strategies and increase engagement.
   Tools Used:- Python(Programing Language)

3. **Pharmaceutical Data Analysis**
   -In my Data Analyst internship with PSYLIQ, I completed an analysis of pharmacy data using MS Excel and Power BI. Key tasks included filtering and sorting data, summarizing product sales for 2023, and applying conditional formatting to highlight significant sales. I created pivot tables and bar charts to visualize sales by product class and channel. Advanced functions like VLOOKUP, nested IF, and data validation were employed for deeper analysis. In Power BI, I built charts to show sales trends and added slicers for dynamic filtering. The project utilized Excel and Power BI‚Äôs capabilities to derive actionable insights from the dataset
   Tools Used:-Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint, Microsoft Power BI
